age, and cold decay,\n""  If all were minded so, the times should cease,\n""  And threescore year would make the world away:\n""  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,\n""  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\n""  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;\n""  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\n""    She carved thee for her seal, and meant

SCENE 1.\n""Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace\n""\n""Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black\n""\n""  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\n""  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;\n""    but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in\n""    ward, evermore in subjection.\n""  LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a\n""    father. He that so generally is at all times good must of\n""    necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it\n""    up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such\n""    abundance.\n""  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?\n""  LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose\n""    practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other\n""    advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.\n""  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how\n""    sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his\n""    honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature  \n""    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for\n""    the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of\n""    the King's disease.\n""  LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?\n""  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his\n""    great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.\n""  LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke\n""    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have\n""    liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.\n""  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?\n""  LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.\n""  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.\n""  LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the\n""    daughter of Gerard de Narbon?\n""  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my\n""    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education\n""    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts\n""    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,\n""    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors\n""    too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives  \n""    her honesty, and achieves her goodness.\n""  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.\n""  COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.\n""    The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the\n""    tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No\n""    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought\n""    you affect a sorrow than to have-\n""  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\n""  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive\n""    grief the enemy to the living.\n""  COUNTESS.

But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the\n""    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.\n""  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will\n""    undermine you and blow you up.\n""  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!\n""    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?\n""  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown  \n""    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves\n""     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth\n""    of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\n""    increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first\n""    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity\n""    by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it\n""    is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.\n""  HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a\n""    virgin.\n""  PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule\n""    of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your\n""    mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs\n""    himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be\n""    buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\n""    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a\n""    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with\n""    feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,\n""    idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\n""    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't.\n""    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly  \n""    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away\n""    with't.\n""  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\n""  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.\n""    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,\n""    the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time\n""    of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of\n""    fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and\n""    the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your\n""    pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,\n""    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it\n""    looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was\n""    formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear.

My dearest madam,\n""    Let not your hate encounter with my love,\n""    For loving where you do; but if yourself,\n""    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\n""    Did ever in so true a flame of liking\n""    Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian\n""    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity\n""    To her whose state is such that cannot choose\n""    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;\n""    That seeks not to find that her search implies,\n""    But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!\n""  COUNTESS.

Disdain\n""    Rather corrupt me ever!\n""  KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which\n""    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\n""    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,\n""    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off\n""    In differences so mighty. If she be\n""    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,\n""    A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st\n""    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.\n""    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\n""    The place is dignified by the doer's deed;\n""    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,\n""    It is a dropsied honour.

She is young, wise, fair;\n""    In these to nature she's immediate heir;\n""    And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn\n""    Which challenges itself as honour's born\n""    And is not like the sire. Honours thrive\n""    When rather from our acts we them derive\n""    Than our fore-goers.
