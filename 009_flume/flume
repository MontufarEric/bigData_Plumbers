flume 

https://data-flair.training/blogs/flume-architecture/

agent---> source, channel, sink
sink --> the reciever
flume event --> one message succesfully transmited


common sources ---> kafka, twitter, spooling, netcat
common channels ---> memory channel, jdbc, kafca channel, file 
common loggers ---> logger sink, hive, hdfs, spark

milti-hop flow  ---> 1 source  2+ sinks 

failure handling ---> there is feedback from the reciever to the generator 

the agent is the task manager of the entire communication pipeline 
*spooldir takes the content of the directory to do the communication. You have to have a dedicated dir for this task to avoid sending extra stuff

to install flume 

download the file 

cd opt
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/flume/1.8.0/apache-flume-1.8.0-bin.tar.gz
mv apache-flume-1.8.0-bin flume-1.8.0

## add FLUME HOME 

export FLUME_HOME=/home/fieldengineer/opt/flume-1.8.0
export PATH=$PATH:$FLUME_HOME/bin

flume-ng version

## now we edit the configuration files 
cd opt.flume-1.8.0/conf 
cp flume-conf.poroperties.template flume-conf.properties

gedit flume-conf.properties


## then we can rename our sources channels sinks and modif modify the capacity of the channel
## all te details of our agent are in this file 
## in flume-nc.conf  we can see an exmaple of a flume agent sourcing a localhost port 
## we write in this port via netcat and then sink this content into the hdfs 
## then we create a dir inn our hdfs 

hdfs dfs -mkdir /flumetest

## and we start our agent by stating the configuration file we are using 

flume -ng agent -n plumber -c conf -f ~/opt/flume-1.-8.0/conf/flume-conf1.properties


# this one works good!
flume-ng agent --name agent --conf-file flume-nc -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console




"""
Once we run the agent with flume-nc, it will start listening to localhost:44444. We can now send messages to that port with netcat or curl. Once we close the communication, a file with everithing we wrote should be added to the hdfs directory we specified.  
"""


*** I removed flume-1.8.0/lib/guava-11.0.2.jar  to solve a problem when trying to sink in the hdfs
