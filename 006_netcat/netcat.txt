we will use netact to get data from a port 
this will configure the listener 

nc localhost  9600 -l

and the sender nc localhost 9600


For Example, in this case, I set my listener in port 9600 and send the incoming text to the a file: 

nc -l 9600 > recieved.txt

now we configure the sender with the proper ip address and port of the listener: 

nc 192.168.0.197 9600
hi
this
is 
a 
net
cat
test
hello world!
hello cat!

We can now we can cat recieved.txt in the listener machine to see the text we have sent from the sender.
